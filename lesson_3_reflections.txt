When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you work from multiple computers you will 
always be able to keep your code updated
without remembering where the most updated 
file is.  If you are working with a group
of people, this will make collaborating much easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would not want Git to pull changes
automaticly, because if it pulls in the
middle of you working that could really
make things difficult for you.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is only to be used while on the GitHub site.
While on GitHub this is how you would clone a
repository to make changes too that you do not
have permission too.  A branch is breaking off the
master branch to add a new feature or experiment
with code without taking the risk of breaking
your solid code.  A branch is built off the commits.
Clones are used to clone from GitHub to a local
machine or if you are cloning from inside your
local machine.
